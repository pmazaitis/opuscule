title: Design Rationale
---

The idea here is to present an audio playback appliance, that accepts UI commands from n sources, and uses those encued commands to manipulate the audio strem coming out of the appliance.

Audio streams are available from components.

Clients are only intended to be used to manipulate appliance state, not play music themselves.
